For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features of your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:

(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or


(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.


1. Principle 1: Equitable Use
   Adherence: SmartMeal allows users to search for recipes based on the ingredients they already have, providing an equitable way for anyone to discover recipes, regardless of what ingredients they have on hand. Additionally, the app enables users to save and rank recipes, ensuring that users can personalize their experience to suit their preferences.

Future Implementation: To further adhere to this principle, we could include more robust support for users with visual impairments, such as screen reader compatibility and the option to change font sizes or colors for improved visibility.

2. Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
   Adherence: The app provides flexibility by allowing users to search for recipes based on available ingredients and adjust the recipe details as needed. Users can save their favorite recipes and rank them according to personal taste, offering them the ability to revisit preferred dishes easily.

Future Implementation: We could enhance flexibility by adding features like customizable grocery lists that allow users to adjust or add additional items to a list based on their preferences or needs, as well as enabling recipe modifications for dietary or ingredient preferences in future versions.

3. Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
   Adherence: SmartMeal is designed with a straightforward interface that emphasizes simplicity. Users can quickly search for recipes by entering ingredients, view recipe details, rank recipes, and generate grocery lists, all with minimal steps. The user flow is clean and intuitive, allowing users to navigate easily between features.

Future Implementation: To make the app even more intuitive, we could include a tutorial or onboarding flow for first-time users, explaining key features in a simple, accessible way to ensure new users understand how to use the app effectively.

4. Principle 4: Perceptible Information
   Adherence: Recipe details, including ingredients and instructions, are presented in a clear and easy-to-read format. Users can easily view the list of ingredients needed to make a recipe, as well as the steps to follow. Additionally, the generated grocery list is clearly displayed, ensuring users know exactly what they need to buy.

Future Implementation: To further enhance perceptibility, we could include visual cues such as icons or color-coding for important recipe information, like highlighting ingredients users are missing from their pantry.

5. Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
   Adherence: The app minimizes the risk of error by providing clear prompts and confirmation messages before actions like deleting saved recipes. Additionally, the search function allows users to correct any input mistakes (such as entering an incorrect ingredient), and they can easily edit or update their saved recipes.

Future Implementation: A feature to "undo" recent changes, such as restoring a deleted recipe or ranking, could further improve error tolerance and provide a safety net for users making accidental changes.

6. Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
   Adherence: SmartMeal is designed to require minimal physical effort, with easy touch interactions for all key features—such as searching for recipes, saving them, and generating grocery lists. The app’s interface is streamlined to ensure users can quickly complete tasks with little effort, making it suitable for users with varying levels of dexterity.

Future Implementation: Introducing voice command support would further reduce physical effort by enabling users to search for recipes, add ingredients to a grocery list, or save recipes without needing to physically interact with the app.

7. Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
   Adherence: The app's design is responsive and ensures that interactive elements like buttons and links are appropriately sized for easy tapping or clicking, which is important for users with limited dexterity or those using larger screens. The layout is optimized for different devices, including phones and tablets.

Future Implementation: To further improve this principle, we could offer adjustable UI elements such as larger text and buttons, or even the ability to customize the layout of the app (e.g., making buttons larger or repositioning elements for easier access).

Future Implementation: We could enhance this principle by including an adjustable interface, where users can customize the size of text or buttons to suit their individual needs (e.g., larger buttons for users with limited dexterity)

Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

If we were to sell or license our program to customers, we would choose to market it towards home cooks, such as busy parents, and students who need recipe ideas for ingredients they have on hand. The app’s unique features such as searching for recipes by ingredients, viewing the details of a recipe, saving recipes, ranking recipes, and generating a grocery list for what ingredients you need to buy to make a recipe would appeal to those who want flexibility and personalization in their cooking. By targeting these groups, our program can provide a convenient, personalized cooking experience that saves time, and reduces food waste.

Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.

While SmartMeal offers a variety of features designed to enhance the cooking experience for users with diverse needs, there are certain demographics that may be less likely to use the app. For example, older adults who may not be as comfortable with technology could find the app's interface intimidating or difficult to navigate, particularly if they have limited experience with smartphones or digital platforms. Additionally, individuals from lower-income backgrounds may not have access to the latest smartphones or reliable internet connections, making it harder for them to fully utilize the app's features, such as ingredient search or online recipe databases. Furthermore, those with limited access to a wide variety of ingredients or who live in food deserts might find the app's focus on ingredient-specific recipes less useful, as they may not have the means to source certain foods. These issues highlight the need for inclusive design that considers not only technological literacy and economic factors but also how food access and cultural diversity impact the usability and effectiveness of digital tools. Addressing these barriers is essential to ensure that the app is accessible and equitable for all users, regardless of their demographic background.
