For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features of your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:

(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or


(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

If we were to sell or license our program to customers, we would choose to market it towards home cooks, such as busy parents, and students who need recipe ideas for ingredients they have on hand. The app’s unique features such as searching for recipes by ingredients, viewing the details of a recipe, saving recipes, ranking recipes, and generating a grocery list for what ingredients you need to buy to make a recipe would appeal to those who want flexibility and personalization in their cooking. By targeting these groups, our program can provide a convenient, personalized cooking experience that saves time, and reduces food waste.

Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.

While SmartMeal offers a variety of features designed to enhance the cooking experience for users with diverse needs, there are certain demographics that may be less likely to use the app. For example, older adults who may not be as comfortable with technology could find the app's interface intimidating or difficult to navigate, particularly if they have limited experience with smartphones or digital platforms. Additionally, individuals from lower-income backgrounds may not have access to the latest smartphones or reliable internet connections, making it harder for them to fully utilize the app's features, such as ingredient search or online recipe databases. Furthermore, those with limited access to a wide variety of ingredients or who live in food deserts might find the app's focus on ingredient-specific recipes less useful, as they may not have the means to source certain foods. These issues highlight the need for inclusive design that considers not only technological literacy and economic factors but also how food access and cultural diversity impact the usability and effectiveness of digital tools. Addressing these barriers is essential to ensure that the app is accessible and equitable for all users, regardless of their demographic background.
