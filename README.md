As a user, John wants to generate recipes from the ingredients he had on hand.

#### Azaria Kelman (azariak)
As a user, Azaria wants to rank his recipes on a scale of 1 to 5, so that he could remember which recipes he likes. He also wants to be able to place them into folders by theme, to make an organized directory.

Sara previously generated her favourite recipe, but
forgot what the ingredients were. She opens the SmartMeal program and 
chooses to load her saved recipes. Her previously saved recipes are displayed 
based on their rank, along with the ingredients, calories, and nutritional benefits 
of each.

Emma needs to meal prep for the week. She opens the meal planning program, selects
her dietary preferences and available ingredients and receives a personalized meal plan with recipes.

Kathy is frustrated as she can’t find recipes that match her dietary restrictions. 
She’s allergic to three things and still wants to have a filling meal. She looks 
for recipes by inputting the ingredients she wants excluded from her meals. She 
saves ones that interest her in a separate folder. As she tries the recipes she 
ranks them out of 5 and removes the recipes she doesn’t like.
